A Computer Vision application to help people make a conscious effort to improve their posture

Presentation about this effort: [https://youtu.be/8YMZSf7-DCY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YMZSf7-DCY)

Dataset with trained Roboflow model: https://universe.roboflow.com/posture-detection-dataset-bgskr/posture-nqt5y/5

# Additional information
Will update this repo as I continue working on it :) 
Steps i still need to take:
1. Expand the dataset and train on another model (MobileNet v2?)
2. Deploy this to a jetson nano or rasberry pi and leave the model running to help improve my posture
3. Have a healthier posture habits!
